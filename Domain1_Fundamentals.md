# Domain 1:  Fundamentals of AI and ML (20%)

## Task 1.1: Explain basic AI concepts and terminologies. 

### Define basic AI terms 

* **AI - Artificial Intelligence**  : Tries to replicate human intelligence with computers.
* **ML - Machine learning**  : A branch of AI that studies how computers can learn and approximate patterns.
* **Neural Networks** : Matrix of neurons, inspired by how the human brain works.
* **Deep learning** : Studies neural networks with several layers
* **computer vision** : 
* natural language processing [NLP]
* **model** : 
* **algorithm** :
* **training** :
* **inferencing** :
* **bias** :
* **fairness** :
* **fit** :
* **large language model**

### Describe the similarities and differences between AI, ML, and deep learning. 

AI is more generic, and includes all simulations of human intelligence, including techniques that do not involve learning, like automated reasoning.
