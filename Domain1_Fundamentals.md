### Define basic AI terms 

* **AI - Artificial Intelligence**  : Tries to replicate human intelligence with computers.
* **ML - Machine learning**  : A branch of AI that studies how computers can learn and approximate patterns.
* **Neural Networks** : Matrix of neurons, inspired by how the human brain works.
* **Deep learning** : Studies neural networks with several layers
* **computer vision** : 
* natural language processing [NLP]
* **model** : 
* **algorithm** :
* **training** :
* **inferencing** :
* **bias** :
* **fairness** :
* **fit** :
* **large language model**

### Describe the similarities and differences between AI, ML, and deep learning. 

**AI** is more generic, and includes all simulations of human intelligence, including techniques that do not involve learning, like automated reasoning.

**Machine learning** involves ways to make computers learn; it usually involves a training phase, where the program learns, and an inference phase, where we use the new learned model. 

A useful family of techniques for ML is **neural networks**, where we describe the model as layers of neurons, each neuron in one layer usually connected to all networks in the previous and the next layer, with different weights attached to each connection (so we can describe the weights between each layer with a matrix). Each neuron is ativated or not (and sometimes partially activated), depending on the sum of its inputs, multiplied by the weights, and usually passed through an activation function.

Learning in neural networks usually involves changing the weights of the connections (and sometimes other parameters within each neuron, modifying the activation function).

**Deep learning** involves learning in neural networks containing more than 3 layers.

### Describe various types of inferencing

* Batch
* Real time
* 

### Describe the different types of data in AI models 

labeled and unlabeled, tabular, time-series, image, text, structured and unstructured
